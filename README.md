# Erasomat

This project presents a novel automatic rotating blackboard. It features a conveyor belt system controlled by an Arduino microcontroller and a DC motor, enabling smooth rotation of the writing surface. To erase content automatically, a brush mechanism is integrated at the back. This brush is connected to a servo motor, providing precise control for forward and backward movements, ensuring thorough removal of markings on the blackboard through friction-based erasing. This design eliminates the need for manual erasing, creating a more efficient and user-friendly experience.
